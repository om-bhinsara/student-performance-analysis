# Student Performance Analysis 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on student exam performance data to understand how various factors influence academic outcomes.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze gender-wise performance differences
- Study the impact of test preparation courses
- Examine the influence of parental education
- Identify subject-wise strengths and weaknesses
- Analyze the effect of socioeconomic factors (lunch type)

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Students Performance in Exams (Kaggle)
- Features include gender, parental education, test preparation, lunch type, and subject-wise scores.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Female students outperform males in reading and writing, while males show stronger performance in mathematics.
- Test preparation significantly improves academic performance.
- Higher parental education correlates with better student outcomes.
- Reading is the strongest subject; mathematics is the weakest.
- Students with standard lunch perform better than those with free/reduced lunch.
